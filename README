INTRODUCTION

Mybox is a centralized file hosting and syncing program. The goal is for it to be an open source version of Dropbox. The software consist of a server and client component. One remote server can host multiple accounts and each account can be used on multiple computers, where all files will be automatically kept in sync across those computers.

For more details on usage and development please see the website listed above.


QUICKSTART

  Nothing needs to be installed. Mybox can be run in user mode. The only program that needs elevated privelages is ServerAdmin since it manages local POSIX accounts.

	Set up executables
		> git clone https://mybox@github.com/mybox/mybox.git
		> wget https://github.com/downloads/mybox/mybox/mybox-dev-includes-0.1.0.tar.gz
		> mkdir mybox/inc && tar -xzf mybox-dev-includes-0.1.0.tar.gz -C mybox/inc
		> cd mybox
		> ant jar
		
		Copy the Mybox home application directory to the client and server machines
		

  On the Server machine
  
    Configure the server
    	> bash mybox.bash ServerSetup
    	
    Set up the user database
    	> mv mybox_server_db.empty.xml mybox_server_db.xml

    Create a user
    	> bash mybox.bash ServerAdmin
    	
    	When it asks enter information to create a new user
      
    Start the Server process:
      > bash mybox.bash Server
      
  On the Client machine
  		
    Run the setup program to configure the client:
      > bash mybox.bash ClientSetup

			Enter the credentials for the user you created on the server
    
    Run the client:
      > bash mybox.bash Client
      
      You should have a ~/Mybox directory which contains your synced files.
      
  
  Note: Make sure your network is configured such that the port being used on the server is accessable.
